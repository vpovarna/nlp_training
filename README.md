NLP Basics
===========
NLP -> text processing (natural language processing)
Text data is unstructured.
Example Use Cases:
 -> Classifying Emails as Spam vs Legitimate
 -> Sentiment Analysis of Text Movie
 -> Analyzing Trends from written customer feedback forms
 -> Understating text commands

 Sometime before doing the nlp on text, a stemming is done to reduce the number of words. 
 Another technique is Lemmatization. 
 Lemmatization is looking at surrounding text to determine the text to reduce.

 Stop Words => common words which doesn't give you extra information: "a", "the", "what"
